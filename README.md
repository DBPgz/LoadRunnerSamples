LoadRunnerSamples
=================

Sample Loadrunner Scripts used by Richard Bishop, Trust IV Ltd
Many of these scripts include snippets of code from the "great and the good" 
in the performance testing world including, Wilson Mar, Stuart Moncrieff, 
Scott Moore, Mark Sibley and Floris Kraak.

I keep them here to act as a repository for my own use and to benefit the
wider performance testing community.
